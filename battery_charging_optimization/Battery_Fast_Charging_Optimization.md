# Case Studies: Battery Fast-Charging Optimization

In this example, we will explore how to apply an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to design batteries optimized for fast charging. You will later implement this in Python.

Our objective is to maximize the areal capacity of the battery during fast charging, specifically at a 4C rate. To achieve this, we will optimize the porosity of the anode and cathode. We conducted 200 experimental trials to establish the relationship between areal capacity and the porosity of these components.

### Diagram of a Battery's Electrode Structure

This image illustrates a simplified diagram of a battery's electrode structure, focusing on the anode and cathode components.

**Structure:**

* **Anode (Left block):** The anode is represented by a blue 3D rectangular block. The label "Anode" is written above the block, and the letter **A** is centered on the face of the block, indicating that **A** represents the electrode area. The concept of anode porosity is noted with a squiggly arrow pointing to the left side of the anode, indicating that this material has some degree of porosity within its structure.
* **Cathode (Right block):** The cathode is depicted as a brown 3D rectangular block, slightly separated from the anode. The label "Cathode" is written above this block. Like the anode, the cathode has cathode porosity, shown by a squiggly arrow pointing to the right side of the cathode, indicating that it also has a porous structure.

**Key Elements:**

* **A: Electrode area:** The letter "A" in the middle of the anode block represents the area of the electrode. This area is a crucial factor in determining the battery's performance.
* **Porosity:** Both the anode and cathode are marked to highlight their porosity, which is essential in battery design as it influences the flow of ions, electrolyte penetration, and the overall efficiency of the electrochemical processes.

**Areal capacity:** Amount of charge a battery can store per unit area of the electrode material, often expressed in mAh/cmÂ².

To facilitate the design process, we will train an ANN with two hidden layers using this experimental data to create a surrogate model. This surrogate model will then be integrated into a gradient-based optimization algorithm to identify the optimal porosity values for both the anode and cathode, thereby maximizing the battery's areal capacity during fast charging.
