    "### What the Kalman Filter Accomplished:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Noise Reduction**: The filter significantly reduced the measurement noise while preserving the underlying signal trend.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **State Estimation**: Even though we only measured position, the filter also estimated velocity internally, which helped improve position predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Optimal Balance**: The Kalman gain automatically balances between:\n",
    "   - Trust in the prediction (based on process noise Q)\n",
    "   - Trust in the measurement (based on measurement noise R)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Parameter Tuning Effects:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Larger Q**: More trust in measurements, faster adaptation to changes\n",
    "- **Larger R**: More trust in predictions, smoother but potentially slower tracking\n",
    "- **Initial P**: Affects convergence speed (high uncertainty = faster initial adaptation)\n",

    "   - Add acceleration: extend state to [position, velocity, acceleration]\n",
    "   - Try non-constant velocity: modify the true motion in the simulation\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Missing measurements**:\n",
    "   - Skip some measurements (set them to `None`) and see how the filter handles gaps\n",
